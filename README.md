Uses Redis Sentinel for a Highly Available Caching cluster

## Master-Replicas with Sentinel

When installing the chart with architecture=replication and sentinel.enabled=true, it will deploy a Redis速 master StatefulSet (only one master allowed) and a Redis速 replicas StatefulSet. In this case, the pods will contain an extra container with Redis速 Sentinel. This container will form a cluster of Redis速 Sentinel nodes, which will promote a new master in case the actual one fails.
